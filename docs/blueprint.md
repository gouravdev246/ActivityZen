## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#90bafc) to evoke a sense of calm focus, suitable for a productivity app.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), a very slightly desaturated near-white to provide a clean backdrop, and is part of a light scheme.
- Accent color: Purple (#9C27B0) to highlight interactive elements and key actions. Its greater saturation makes it pop.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for readability and a modern touch.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for high-impact headlines and smaller snippets of text
- Use consistent and clear icons from a standard library (e.g., Material Icons) to represent task categories and actions.
- Clean, card-based layout to clearly differentiate tasks and sections.
- Subtle transition animations when tasks are marked as complete or when filters are applied.
